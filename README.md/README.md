Project 1 - Pandas and Sharks

Overview
The aim of this project is to clean and format a dataset containing information about shark attacks, and use the data to answer the questions I have decided to ask based on this dataset. 

Requirements/Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn

Questions
1 - Which are the most hazardous species and in which countries are there the most sharks attacks?
2 - What types of injuries are the most common? Is it related to the age range?
3 - How probable is it that you can survive if you are attacked by a shark?


Question 1 - Which are the most hazardous species and in which countries are there the most sharks attacks?
# Graph "Top 10 hazardous shark species should be here. 
As it can be seen in the following histogram, the top 10 hazardous shark species are the White Shark (number 1), the Lemon shark, the Bull shark, the Reef shark, the Nurse shark, the Wobbegong shark, the Blacktip shark, the Spinner shark, the Mako shark and the Blue shark. In other words, they are the ones that have been attacking the most. 

Besides, the countries with more shark attacks are USA, Australia and South Africa. Undoubtedly, one of the main reasons is because they have large coasts. Also, it can be concluded that the White shark is the one with more prevalence in South Africa, while in USA and Australia, there are some other species that are the hunters of human bodies as the Bull shark, the Nurse shark, and the Wobeggong shark. 

If you are going on holidays, be aware of the destination you choose, unless you want to have an experience of a shark bite. 

Question 2 - What types of injuries are the most common? Is it related to the age range?
# Graph "Type of injury per age" should be here. 
In the following bar plot, it is important to see that sharks do not have a preference for a part of the humam body. They can attack any of the parts, although they prefer extremities as no boobs or penis are mentioned in the dataset. 

Luckily, not many kids get an injury from a shark. Thus, it can be said that as more adult we become, more adventurous and risky (or stupid) we are. 
There is not a specific correlation between the type of the injury and the age but it is necessary to visualise that old people are the ones who are more probable to lose their lives if they are attacked. But in general, this is what happens with old people. They lose their lives with anything because they become weaker as they age. 
Furthermore, the median of all injuries has a range of 24 and 47. Another evidence of why as we age, we become more shark-attractive, or again, more stupid. 


Question 3 - How probable is it that you can survive if you are attacked by a shark?
# Graph "Rate of survival/death by shark attacs" should be here. 
Yes, you can survive, but not too much. Only a 24% of the attacked people have survived. If you are lucky, you can be part of the 24%. But, it is important to mention that this dataset contains information including very old registers. Probably, nowadays, the rate of survival would be higher due to better first aid and newest technology. 

Anyway, be aware that if you are fully eaten by sharks, still there is no way to recover your pieces and create a new version of you. We are not in any of those movies that show future scenarios. We still are in 2023. So, allow yourself to be eaten by a shark if you want to be in the news (after your death) or you want to live forever in the sea forever and visit SpongeBob. 

Conclusions

1- Try to avoid areas with White sharks if you do not want to be attacked.
2- If you want to have an injury by a shark, you should start thinking of travelling to the USA, Australia or South Africa. 
3- You may lose an extremity if you are attacked, but stay calm, you won't lose the most important: your genitals or boobs. 
4- Avoid taking your parents or grandparents to these excursions, unless you want an inheritance.
5- If you want to become famous, let yourself be attacked by sharks. 
6- There is still no body recovery system if you die. If you are looking for it, you should travel to the future.
